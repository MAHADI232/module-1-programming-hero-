    <p><i>In 1980</i>, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a <small>contractor</small> at CERN, proposed and
         prototyped <span>ENQUIRE</span>, a system for CERN researchers to use and share 
         documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo <b>proposing</b> an Internet
         -based hypertext <strong>system.[3]</strong>  Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally
         adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed 
         "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia
          is the first entry.[4]</p>

        <P>The <em>first publicly</em> available description of HTML was a document
         called "HTML Tags",[5] first mentioned on the Internet by Tim B
         erners-Lee in late 1991.[6][7] It describes 18 elements comprising 
         the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for the
          hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an 
          in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based
           documentation 
          format at CERN. Eleven of these elements 
          still exist in HTML 4.[8]</p>
